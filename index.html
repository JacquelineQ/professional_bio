    <h2 class='banner'>About Me</h2>
    <p>I have always been fascinated by science, technology and the arts. In university, I studied French and Biology before becoming a tutor which allowed me to teach others about these things that I love. Becoming a developper was the fruition of years of falling down rabbit holes, teaching others, and always trying to learn something new. I love being able to use my new skills to help others learn new things!</p>
  <p>When I'm not at my computer you can find me:
    <ul>
      <li>SCUBA Diving</li>
      <li>Learning a new language</li>
      <li>Playing Stardew Valley</li>
    </ul>
